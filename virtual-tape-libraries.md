# Managing Virtual tape library

{: #manage-vtl}

Virtual Tape Libraries are devices that are commonly used to backup IBM i data. The Power Systems Virtual Server replicates the on-premises solution by providing a software VTL appliance that can be dynamically provisioned in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.

{: shortdesc}

FalconStor Virtual Tape Library (VTL) is an optimized backup and deduplication solution that provides tape library emulation, high-speed backup or restore, data archival to supported S3 clouds for long-term storage, global data deduplication, enterprise-wide replication, and long-term cloud-based container archive, without requiring changes to the existing environment.

For more information on how to create and configure an {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} running the FalconStor VTL software in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [FalconStor VTL for IBM Deployment Guide](https://falconstor-download.s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/FalconStor%20VTL%20for%20IBM%20Deployment%20Guide.pdf){: external}.
