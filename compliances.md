## SOC
{: soc-cert}

The System and Organization Controls (SOC) framework, developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), is a standard for controls that protect information stored in the cloud. Certified public accountants (CPAs) audit cloud service providers (CSPs), resulting in internal control reports on the services provided by a service organization. SOC reports can help users assess and address the risks associated with an outsourced service.

SOC 1 is an audit of the internal controls at a service organization implemented to protect client-owned data involved in client financial reporting. SOC 1 audits and reports are based on the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE 18) and the International Standards for Assurance Engagements No. 3402 (ISAE 3402).

SOC 2 audits, based on the AICPA Trust Service Principles and Criteria, gauge service organization internal controls implemented to protect customer-owned data. SOC 2 reports provide details about the nature of those internal controls.

## HIPAA
{: HIPAA-cert}

The US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act define standards for handling electronic healthcare transactions and information. If you or your company is a covered entity as defined by HIPAA, you must enable the HIPAA Supported setting if you run sensitive workloads that are regulated under HIPAA and the HITECH Act. By using this setting, you can filter on HIPAA Enabled services in the catalog, indicate to IBM that your account stores protected health information (PHI), and digitally accept the IBM Business Associate Addendum for covered entities. For more information, see [Enabling HIPAA support for your account](docs/account?topic=account-enabling-hipaa).

## ISO 27017:2015
