# Cloud native development and application modernization by using Red Hat OpenShift on Power Systems Virtual Server
{: #app-modernization-using-RedHat-openshift}

Cloud-native applications are the applications that are **born in the cloud**, which means that the applications use microservice-based architecture, containers, and a corresponding container orchestration platform. Red Hat&reg; OpenShift&reg; is enterprise Kubernetes platform enabling IT organizations to develop applications faster, deploy them reliably, and manage them efficiently.

<!--By packaging and running existing monolithic applications within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, enterprises can achieve a lower infrastructure footprint, lower maintenance and support costs, and easier portability across a range of cloud infrastructure and platform services.-->

In addition to developing new cloud-native applications, IT organizations are modernizing older, monolithic core business applications to support the faster delivery of new function to the business.
