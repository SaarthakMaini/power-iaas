# Direct Link Connect for Power Systems Virtual Servers
{: #ordering-direct-link-connect}

You must use [Direct Link](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-link) to configure your private network with a IBM&reg; Power Systems&trade; Virtual Server. The Direct Link Connect 2.0 service creates a seamless connection that allows access to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} resources from your {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} instance. Direct Link Connect is a separate service from the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} service. For more information on Direct Link Connect, see [Pricing for IBM Cloud Direct Link](/docs/dl?topic=dl-pricing-for-ibm-cloud-dl) and [IBM Cloud Direct Link Connect on Classic](/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-connect).
{: shortdesc}

The Direct Link (2.0) provides the following advantages:

- Metered billing, which lowers the barrier of entry to IBM Cloud.
- Support for connections to multiple IBM Cloud accounts from a single direct link.
- Support for multiple VPCs (without classic access) from a single direct link within the same account.

Dircet Link 2.0 is available in all current locations except Toronto 1. For Toronto 1 location, you must use [IBM Cloud Direct Link on Classic](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-about-ibm-cloud-direct-link){: new_window}{: external}. Moreover, if you are using Direct Link Connect on Classic in any current location, you can continue to use it with Power Systems Virtual Server. If you want to use Direct Link Connect 2.0, you must order a new Direct Link Connect 2.0 connection.
{: note}

The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} offering now includes a highly available 5 Gbps connection to IBM Cloud services at no cost for each customer per data center. If desired, you can select the global routing option for these links at no cost. Over the next few months, the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} service plans to continue toÂ evolve its network connectivity capabilities through further automation and integration. To learn more about this offer, see [Getting started with IBM Cloud Direct Link on Classic](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-link){: new_window}{: external}.

## Ordering Direct Link Connect 2.0
{: #order-direct-link-connect-2.0}
{: #help}
{: support}

To order the Direct Link Connect 2.0 service that creates a connection to the Power Systems Virtual Server instance, complete the following steps:

Order a second Direct Link Connect connection for backup purposes.
{: tip}

1. Verify that your IBM Cloud account has the correct authorizations to order the Direct Link 2.0 Connect service.

2. Review the following basic Direct Link Connect networking concepts:

   - [Direct Link Connect concepts](/docs/dl?topic=dl-dl-about)
   - [Direct link prerequisites](/docs/dl?topic=dl-ibm-cloud-dl-prerequisites)

3. Log in to your [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: new_window}{: external} account. 

4. Click [Menu icon](./images/menuicon.png) on the upper left, then click **Interconnectivity**.

5. Click **Order Direct Link** and select the **Direct Link Connect** option.

6. Enter the [configuration parameters](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-ordering-direct-link-connect#direct-link) for your IBM Cloud Direct Link Connect order. As you complete the fields for creating the Direct Link Connect service, the price is automatically updated to reflect your selections.

   The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} service offers lower latency direct connectivity to customers. You must select **IBM POWER VIRTUAL SERVER** as the **Network Provider** instead of **MEGAPORT**.
   {: note}

7. Read the *Master Service Agreement* and select the checkbox. You must read and understand the Master Service Agreement as it contains important technical information.

8. Click **Create**. A message similar to the following image is displayed when your request is submitted successfully.
   ![Direct Link Connect success message and ticket number](./images/console-direct-link-message.png "Direct Link Connect success message and ticket number"){: caption="Figure 1. Direct Link Connect success message and ticket number" caption-side="bottom"}

9. Click the **Case number** link for the Direct Link Connect service. The information in the case number is used to identify the Direct Link Connect information for connecting your Power Systems Virtual Server instance.

   It can take up to three business days to complete the initial setup for the Direct Link connection request.
   {: note}

   To create a connection to the Power Systems Virtual Server instance by using the Direct Link Connect service, create a [new support case](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-help-and-support) against the Power Systems Virtual Server team. In the new case's description field, add the **Direct Link Connect case number**.

10. When the Direct Link Connect connection is established, the Direct Link Connect case is closed. The following network information is an example of what is displayed:

    ```
    Link Speed:                  1000 Mbps
    Location:                    Dallas 13
    Network Provider:            IBM Power Virtual Server
    Direct Link Connect subnet:  10.254.0.24/30
    IBM Cloud IP Address:        10.254.0.25/30
    Customer IP Address:         10.254.0.26/30
    IBM Cloud ASN:               13884
    Customer BGP ASN:            64999
    Network Identifier:          1748523-1
    Date Created:                2019-06-12T14:56:45-06:00
    ```
    {: screen}

11. Use the information from the Direct Link Connect case number to update the **{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} support case**:

    The **{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} network** autonomous system number (ASN) is the same as your Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) ASN. The IBM Cloud network team generates the **IBM Cloud ASN** and adds it to the IBM Cloud support ticket. The IBM Cloud network team also generates the IP addresses. Your private network name is your Power Systems Virtual Server private network subnet name.
    {: note}

    ```
    Customer name:
    Customer account ID:
    Direct Link Connect subnet:
    IBM Cloud IP address:
    Power Systems Virtual Server network IP address:
    IBM Cloud ASN:
    Power Systems Virtual Server network ASN:
    Power Systems Virtual Server Private Network (subnet) Name (1):
    Power Systems Virtual Server Private Network (subnet) Name (2):
    Power Systems Virtual Server Private Network (subnet) Name (3):
    ```

12. The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} support case is closed when the Direct Link Connect connection is configured to communicate with your Power Systems Virtual Server instance.

## Deleting your Direct Link Connect on Classic connection
{: deleting-direct-link}

You can remove your Direct Link Connect on Classic connection by [opening a support ticket](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-help-and-support) against the Power Systems Virtual Server support team to remove the appropriate resources.
