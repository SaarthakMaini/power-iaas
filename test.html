<ol><li>For a capped partition, the amount of CPU time is capped to the value specified for the entitlement. For example, the partition could consume at most 30 seconds of CPU time every minute for a capped partition with processing units set to 0.5.</li><li>For an uncapped partition, the number of virtual processors defines the upper limit of CPU consumption and not the value specified for processing units. For example, if virtual processors are set to 3, the partition could consume 180 second of CPU time every minute (3 virtual processors each running at 100% utilization would be 3 physical cores worth of CPU time). There must be unused capacity available on the server for partition to consume more than its configured processing units.</li></ol></p>|
