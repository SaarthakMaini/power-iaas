<p>Shared processor configurations consist of several factors. The entitled capacity (EC) defines the minimum guaranteed
    amount of CPU time a partition can run on physical cores. For example, if the processor units are set to **0.5**,
    the logical partition would be guaranteed 30 seconds of CPU time every minute. If a logical partition doesnâ€™t use
    all of its entitlement, the remaining CPU time is automatically made available for other shared processor
    partitions. For shared processors, there are two sharing modes, capped or uncapped:
    <ol>
        <li>For a capped partition, the amount of CPU time is capped to the value specified for the entitlement. For
            example, the partition could consume at most 30 seconds of CPU time every minute for a capped partition with
            processing units set to 0.5.</li>
        <li>For an uncapped partition, the number of virtual processors defines the upper limit of CPU consumption and
            not the value specified for processing units. For example, if virtual processors are set to 3, the partition
            could consume 180 second of CPU time every minute (3 virtual processors each running at 100% utilization
            would be 3 physical cores worth of CPU time). There must be unused capacity available on the server for
            partition to consume more than its configured processing units.</li>
    </ol>
