# Modifying a Power Systems Virtual Server instance
{: #modifying-server}

Learn how to modify your {{site.data.keyword.powerSysShort}} to better meet your business needs.
{: shortdesc}

## Resizing an instance by using the IBM Cloud console
{: #resizing-vm}

To resize a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} instance after its [initial creation](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-creating-power-virtual-server), complete the following steps:

1. Go to the IBM Cloud console's **Virtual server instances** tab and click your instance.

2. Click the **Edit** icon in the **Server details** pane.

3. After you click the **Edit** icon, a menu appears. Use the toggles to change your instance's **Entitled capacity** and **Memory (GB)**. Click **Next.**

    If the VM is inactive, you can change the processor type to **Dedicated processor**, **Uncapped shared processor** or **Capped shared processor** and adjust the amount of memory however you'd like. The minimum and maximum values for **Memory (GB)** and **Entitled capacity** are recalculated based on the type of processor. When you choose to resize an active VM, you cannot change the processor type. The minimum amount of **Memory (GB)** and **Entitled capacity** are half of what was allocated at provisioning time, while their maximum amounts are double.

4. Check the service agreement box and click **Order** to complete the instance modification process and accept the price.

5. To verify your instance modification, view your **Server details**.

## Managing your storage volumes
{: #modifying-volume-network}

Learn how to add new storage volumes and modify existing ones. Currently, you cannot mix **Tier 1** and **Tier 3** storage types in the **us-south (DAL13)**, **us-east (TOR01-only)**, **eu-de (FRA04/FRA05)**, and **eu-gb (LON06)** regions.

### Adding and managing storage volumes
{: #adding-managing-volume}

1. To add a storage volume, click **New volume**.

2. Enter the **Name**, **Type**, and **Size** of the new storage volume. You can also select whether to make it **Shareable** and set an **Affinity policy**.

    Volume affinity allows you to control the placement of a new volume in a particular storage provider based on an existing volume. When you set an affinity policy for a new storage volume, the volume is created within the same storage provider as an existing volume. With an anti-affinity policy, the new volume is created in a different storage provider as an existing volume.
    {: note}

3. Click **Next**, agree to the service agreement, and submit your **Order**.

To attach or detach one or more volumes, click **Manage existing volumes**. Select your wanted volumes and click **Finish**. To simply change the boot status of a volume, click the **Bootable** toggle.

### Resizing a storage volume
{: #resizing-volume}
{: help}
{: support}

You can resize a storage volume after its initial creation. To delete a volume, its status must indicate one of the following states: **available**, **error**, **error_restoring**, **error_extending**, or **error_managing**. Additionally, the storage volume cannot be deleted if it is migrating, attached, belongs to a group, has snapshots, or is disassociated from its snapshots after a transfer.

Resizing is not immediately available after you deploy a VM.
{: important}

1. Go to the IBM Cloud console and click the **Storage volumes** tab.

2. Click the **Edit** icon to the right of your storage volume.

3. After you click the **Edit** icon, a menu appears. Select your wanted storage volume size. You can only increase the size of the storage volume.

    ![Modifying your storage volume](./images/console-modify-volume.png "Modifying your storage volume"){: caption="Figure 5. Modifying your storage volume" caption-side="bottom"}

4. Read the service agreement and agree to the terms. Click **Order** to complete the volume modification process and accept the price.

5. To verify your new storage size, go back to the **Storage volumes** tab.

## Adding or removing a public network
{: #adding-removing-network}

You can remove or add a public network by clicking the **Public networks** toggle. When you toggle a public network off and then on, the IBM Cloud console regenerates new internal and external IP addresses. You need to check the IBM Cloud console for the new internal IP address (that maps to the external IP address). You must add a network interface controller (NIC) and point it to the new internal IP address. For information on how to add or remove an interface, see [How to add or remove a network interface from an AIX virtual machine (VM)](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-managing-network-interface) or [How to add or remove a network interface from an IBM i virtual machine (VM)](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-managing-network-interface-ibmi).

You cannot toggle a public network off if there are no other defined networks.
